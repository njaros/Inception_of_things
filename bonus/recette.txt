thing that i've done for it to work: run make
do port forwarding to connect to gitlab
connect to gitlab
go into the setting, general tab, import and export setting, and allow import from https url plus the little option below (the box to check)
return on the main gitlab page
got to the project page and click on import from project
enter the github wil repo url, click on the group and mouve the mousse for the group rrot to appear and select it,
put the repo in public
now the repo should synchronize, it can take some time but it should result in having the exact same repo as the one on github
now go to argocd and modify the wil app to change the repourl to sync to this one : http://gitlab-webservice-default.gitlab.svc.cluster.local:8181/root/jrinna_Iot_p3.git/
this should save without complainning about the url, if the url is a bad url or argocd can't acces the repo the change will not be saved and a warnning should pop
